This webpage was crafted using the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library for dynamic animations. Additionally, CSS animations have been seamlessly integrated to enhance the visual experience.

## Cursor
This website features a unique custom cursor designâ€”instead of the traditional cursor, it utilizes a rounded cursor that dynamically follows your mouse pointer as you navigate through the site. Additionally, it incorporates various animations that activate when hovering over different elements on the website.

## Home Page

On the homepage of this website, you'll find a unique navigation bar on the right side.  Meanwhile, on the left side, you'll discover essential links that direct you to various profiles across different platforms. These links are conveniently fixed in position, ensuring easy access as you navigate through the site. 

Both the navigation bar and the links feature special hover effects, adding a touch of interactivity and enhancing the user experience. As a beginner, implementing these effects may have presented challenges, but they serve to elevate the website's design and functionality.

In the central section of the homepage, you'll find a personal introduction where I share my name. This section features a captivating text mask effect: when you hover your cursor over the text, it dynamically reveals hidden content while temporarily concealing the initial text. It's a subtle yet engaging way to draw attention and add an element of intrigue to the introduction.
