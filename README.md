# Personal-Portfolio
This visually appealing personal portfolio website features five sections and a loading page, all created from scratch.

## Loading Page

This webpage was crafted using the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library for dynamic animations. Additionally, CSS animations have been seamlessly integrated to enhance the visual experience.

## Cursor
This website features a unique custom cursor design—instead of the traditional cursor, it utilizes a rounded cursor that dynamically follows your mouse pointer as you navigate through the site. Additionally, it incorporates various animations that activate when hovering over different elements on the website.

## Home Page

On the homepage of this website, you'll find a unique navigation bar on the right side.  Meanwhile, on the left side, you'll discover essential links that direct you to various profiles across different platforms. These links are conveniently fixed in position, ensuring easy access as you navigate through the site. 

Both the navigation bar and the links feature special hover effects, adding a touch of interactivity and enhancing the user experience. As a beginner, implementing these effects may have presented challenges, but they serve to elevate the website's design and functionality.

In the central section of the homepage, you'll find a personal introduction where I share my name. This section features a captivating text mask effect: when you hover your cursor over the text, it dynamically reveals hidden content while temporarily concealing the initial text. It's a subtle yet engaging way to draw attention and add an element of intrigue to the introduction.

## About Me Page

In the "About Me" section, you'll find a glimpse into who I am, with various animations enhancing the space. Specifically, I've incorporated GSAP scroll trigger animations to bring elements to life as you navigate through the content.

Within this subsection of the "About Me" section, you'll find a list detailing my professional activities and interests. However, there's a twist: when you hover over each item in the list, it reveals the true essence of what I do. This juxtaposition between formality and reality adds an engaging element to the presentation, inviting visitors to explore beyond the surface.

## Education Page

In the education section, I've showcased my supposed motivations and achievements. However, there's a twist: when you hover over the text, it reveals the truth - that I'm actually a self-proclaimed "lazy person." Additionally, these animations were created using the GSAP library.

This section showcases my educational timeline and the institutions attended. Hovering over the timeline reveals the institutions, providing a seamless browsing experience for visitors.

This section serves as evidence of my beginner status in the field. While I may not yet have any completed projects to showcase, I've incorporated special animations into the empty project section for your exploration.
